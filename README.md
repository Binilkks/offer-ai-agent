# Voice-Based Offer Agent (POC)

This project is a **proof-of-concept voice agent** that interacts with users to present an offer, listen to their responses, and guide the conversation using AI. It integrates **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text**, **LangChain Groq LLM**, and a **state machine workflow** via LangGraph.  

---

## Features

- Reads out offer details to the user using **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**.
- Listens to user responses via microphone and transcribes them using **Google Speech-to-Text**.
- Uses **Groq LLM** to analyze the userâ€™s query and determine the next action:
  - Request **consent** for the offer.
  - **Decline** the offer.
  - **Handoff** to a live agent for unrelated questions.
  - Provide **clarifications** if the user asks questions about the offer.
- Workflow is managed via a **state graph** to handle conversation flow.
- Plays audio responses using **sounddevice**.
